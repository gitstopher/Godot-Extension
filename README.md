For my assignment it is a GDExample class taken from the godot documentation we did in class, it inherits a Sprite2D and provides movement with the sprite moving in a circular pattern, pulsing to see the sprite scale up and down, signals such as pulse\_finished and sprite\_scaled emitted during runtime. The node responds to a button press and update's a labels text. In the inspector parameters you are able to adjust the movement radius and the scale speed.



To try and use you would make a GDExample node as a child of Node2D. Assign label and button node paths in the inspector label\_path and button\_path. Adjust movement radius and scale speed in the inspector  to control behavior.



I used AI to help me build the cpp and h files as I used it to help me implement the new features and bind them to the inspector allowing them to be adjustable and have the features actually work correctly, although I think my label and button doesn't do all the features they are supposed to be able to do.
